Video Wall Demo for New Relic Hackathon
=======================================

This was a quick and (very) dirty demo I put together for a New Relic hackathon event.

The basic idea is to bind together two hallways via video while updating the
perspective as someone walks down the hallway.  This is done using clusters of
3 webcams on each side and motion detection to determine which perspective to
show.

Be warned, this code leaks and will definitely eat your cat.
